# George Felobes, P.Eng.

I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer specializing in generative AI, large language model systems, and intelligent automation. My background spans mechanical engineering, optimization, and control systems, with a strong focus on designing and deploying production-grade AI platforms.

My technical interests include multi-agent systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), MLOps, and scalable backend infrastructure. I enjoy building systems that combine reliability, performance, and practical impact across both software and industrial domains.

I’m open to collaborating on meaningful AI projects, particularly those involving orchestration platforms, decision engines, and advanced workflow automation.
